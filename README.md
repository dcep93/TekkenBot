# TekkenBot

GUI to study frame data while in game.

Created by roguelike2d. Maintained by the community.

### Note: Do not move the exe to a different folder - it needs to be able to see the 'assets' directory. Create a shortcut if you want to have an easy reference file.

## New Features in this fork

### Code

- [x] The main purpose of this project was to simplify the code so that other devs can more easily iterate or fork
- [x] I'll watch the github issues tab for improvements/bug fixes when they're posted

### Record/Replay

- [x] Record and replay feature built. Intended for combo construction/hypothetical scenario validation. Could potentially be used for cheating, but would need a nefarious coder to implement, as the current iteration requires clicking on the button, and there is a delay.
- [x] Recording works for both players to allow easy creation, editing, and sharing of TAS duels.
- [x] Shows the distance from 2.00 the player is after the recording finishes. Can be used for kbd practice.

### TODO

- [ ] fresh images
- [ ] documentation
