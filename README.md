## New Features in this fork

### Code

-   [x] The main purpose of this project was to simplify the code so that other devs can more easily iterate or fork

### Frame Data

-   [x] Characters' frame data is imported from rbnorway - when that move is detected, its data is shown instead of reading game state
-   [x] When an unknown move is performed, its data is remembered so that next time there are fewer 'unknown' values
-   [x] Shows data for whiffed moves too

### Taking Requests

-   [x] I'll watch the github issues tab for improvements/bug fixes when they're posted

### TODO

-   [ ] Finish transcribing moves for remaining cast
-   [ ] Throws - how to break and importing from rbnorway
-   [ ] What do do about moves that have more than one hit for a single input
